# SpaceX-capstone-with-IBM
The goal of the project is to determine the price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards. By determining whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage
